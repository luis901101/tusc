  ///
  /// This needs to be a function (not a stream) so that uploads can be [cancelled]
  /// and [resumed] without creating a new [TusStreamClient] instance.
  ///
  /// When an upload is [cancelled], the current stream is [closed].
  /// To [resume] the upload, a new stream instance is requiredâ€”hence the need
  /// for a function that can generate it on demand.
  ///
  /// This is an example of how to create a Tus client instance to upload from
  /// a file:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// import 'dart:io';
  /// import 'package:tusc/tusc.dart';
  ///
  /// Future<void> initTus() async {
  ///   File file = File('');
  ///   final tus = TusClient(
  ///     url: 'https://example.com/tus',
  ///     fileStreamGenerator: () => file.openRead(),
  ///     fileSize: await file.length(),
  ///     fileName: file.path,
  ///   );
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// If re-creating the stream is not possible or very expensive
  /// (e.g., it's from a one-time network request), your options are:
  ///
  /// 1. Don't cancel the upload, just pause/resume it. This will be your only
  /// option, if the stream is from a file excessively large to fit in memory.
  /// 2.If the stream is not from a file excessively large to fit in memory,
  /// then you could read the entire stream into memory once and then create
  /// new streams from that buffered data, for example:
  /// ```dart
  /// import 'dart:typed_data';
  /// import 'package:tusc/tusc.dart';
  ///
  /// Future<Uint8List> bufferStream(Stream<List<int>> stream) async {
  ///   final builder = BytesBuilder();
  ///   await for (final chunk in stream) {
  ///     builder.add(chunk);
  ///   }
  ///   return builder.toBytes();
  /// }
  ///
  /// Future<void> initTus(Stream<List<int>> stream) async {
  ///   final bufferedData = await bufferStream(stream);
  ///   final tus = TusClient(
  ///     url: 'https://example.com/tus',
  ///     fileStreamGenerator: () => Stream.fromIterable([bufferedData]),
  ///     fileSize: bufferedData.length,
  ///     fileName: 'example.txt',
  ///   );
